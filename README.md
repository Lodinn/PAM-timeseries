# Time series analysis for PAM fluorometry data
This is the code repository accompanying the paper
*Non-invasive probing of winter dormancy via time-frequency analysis of induced chlorophyll fluorescence in deciduous plants as exemplified by apple (Malus Ã— domestica Borkh.)* by Boris Shurygin, Ivan Konyukhov, Sergei Khruschev, and Alexei Solovchenko.

It contains the following notebooks:
- timeseries_main.ipynb - main part of the analysis
- forward_modeling.ipynb - comparison with chill requirement models
- toy_wavelet.ipynb - corresponds to supplementary materials theoretical background and illustrates wavelet usage 

Plots in these notebooks are based on the full dataset; we also provide sample data here covering the winter 2020/2021 season (sample_data.csv).
